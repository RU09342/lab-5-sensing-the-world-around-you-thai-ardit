# Lab 5: Getting a sense of the world around you

So far, you have had really only looked at what your microcontroller has inside of it and how to
get internal peripherals to behave with one another. Now it is time to start thinking about 
how the microcontroller can see the world. In previous labs, you have brought your controller from 
the mouth of the stork (or from the package from TI), fed it electrons, got it to say its first words, 
and helped it make its first steps. You have spent many sleepless night consoling your quintuplets when
they threw tantrums, sometimes making you question your commitment to become a Junior ECE; but now it is time 
to send your little prodigies to kindergarten to make you proud. They will learn all about the world around them, 
not just the binary conditions of your dreary lifestyle. 

## Goals for the lab:
By the end of this lab, you should:

* Interface your microcontrollers to multiple sensor types (voltage, current, and resistive)
*
 Design Multiple types of signal conditioning circuits for these types of sensors.
* Access and set up the 
internal ADC's
* Design a basic breakout board for the MSP430FR2311

## Deliverables
By the end of the lab, 
you will need to provide at a minimum well documented main.c files for *EACH* of the 5 development platforms.
 You will also need to provide a README at the top of each section in your repository. 
The reason I say minimum is because there are going to be some recommended further practice that is not mandatory, 
but heavily recommended, especially if you are finishing this lab in only a couple hours. So come Milestone time,
 I should see 3 folders in your repository with the following titles:
* PCB Design
* Sensors and Signal Conditioning
*
 Visualizing Data

each with the .c and README files for each board. The .c and README files should include 
the minimum amount of work as well as any extra work that you
have done. Each processor should have its project saved in its own folder in each part of the assignment,
 however you only need one README per part of the assignment.

### README Files
Since most of these projects 
will have just a simple main.c file, you do not need to generate 20 README files. 
Instead, unless you go for a more advanced implementation of the exercises, you just need 
1 README per exercise folder. "But how do I make a README with all of the processors included?"
 Well now we are getting somewhere. You should talk about the general form of your code as it should be
 very similar for each processor, but you should highlight what the differences are between each processor. 
For example, do the clocks need to be initialized differently? As another step forward, you could take that 
information and somehow make it where your code would work on any of the processors without the need to change
 it between projects.

### Header Files
You may find yourself by the end of this lab not having generated any 
header files, which in this case, ignore this section. If you have generated more than just a main.c you most
 likely have yourself a .h file or two. Remember from the first lab that any header files or libraries that you 
generate need to have their own README.md which tell the user what dependencies there are, how to install 
them into their projects, etc.

## Documentation
Since you will most likely be using pre-made code to make most 
of your code, so what I am going to require you to do is comment each line of code and what it is doing. 
If you are using code from TI themselves, it will most likely have some of the comments there. But I want 
you to use your own words when writing these comments. Dive into the datasheets, look into the MSP430.h file
 to see what registers are being manipulated and tell me why you need to configure them.
